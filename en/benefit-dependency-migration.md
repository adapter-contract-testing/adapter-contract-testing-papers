Migrate Without Stress: Don’t Break Down in the Middle of the Ocean
===

Migrations of technical stacks, versions, or database models are a source of stress.  
Several challenges arise on the horizon:
- Does everything work as before?
- Will there be unexpected side effects in my application?
- Have I successfully carried over all the necessary behaviors to the new version?

So, do we tackle the issue with our favorite lucky charm, or do we equip ourselves with a solid safety net?

For several years, Johan Martinsson and I have been using the [Adapter Contract Testing](README.md) technique, 
which allows us to migrate our dependencies with great peace of mind ☯️.  
Based on hexagonal architecture, this method offers significant advantages:

- 🎣 **Capturing essential behaviors**: Only the behaviors necessary for our application are isolated behind the port/adapter pattern. This ensures that we depend on and test only the bare minimum.
- 🛟 **Enhanced testability**: In just a few lines, it is possible to verify that the new partner meets expectations. This reliable safety net provides a clear view of what remains to be done.
- 👣 **Progressive migration**: Thanks to dependency inversion and parallel changes, it becomes possible to migrate step by step, without rushing, rather than diving in all at once.

**Example: Step-by-step database migration:**

To migrate a database progressively, it becomes possible to write an adapter that writes to both databases while reading
from only one. This approach allows data to be transferred gradually and switched over once the migration is complete.

This method offers a controlled transition, minimizing risks and strengthening confidence in partner changes.
